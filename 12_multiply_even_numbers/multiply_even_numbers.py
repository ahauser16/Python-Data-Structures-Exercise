# Pros: This function is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers and an if statement to check if each number is even. Cons: It traverses the entire list, which can be inefficient for large lists if the even numbers are found early.

# Pros: This function uses the reduce function from the functools module, which provides a high-level, efficient way to apply a function to all elements in a list. Cons: It's more complex than the first function and may be harder to understand for someone not familiar with the reduce function.  See breakdown below:

# 'return': This is a keyword in Python used to exit a function and return a value.

# 'reduce': This is a function from the functools module in Python. It applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single output.

# 'lambda x, y: x * y if y % 2 == 0 else x': This is a lambda function, which is a small anonymous function. 'x' and 'y' are the parameters of this function, 'x * y if y % 2 == 0 else x' is the body of the function.

# 'if y % 2 == 0 else x': This is a conditional expression (or ternary operator) in Python. It evaluates to 'x * y' if 'y' is even, and 'x' otherwise.

# 'nums': This is a variable that refers to the list of numbers passed as an argument to the 'multiply_even_numbers2' function.

# Pros: This function uses the numpy library, which provides powerful tools for numerical computations. It's more efficient than the other two functions for large inputs because it operates at the C level in Python's implementation. Cons: It's more complex than the other two functions and may be harder to understand for someone not familiar with numpy. It also requires the numpy library, which is not part of Python's standard library.

# return: This is a keyword in Python used to exit a function and return a value.

# np.prod(nums[nums % 2 == 0]): This is a function call to np.prod, which computes the product of all the elements in the input array. nums[nums % 2 == 0] is a boolean indexing operation that selects the even numbers from nums.

# if np.any(nums % 2 == 0): This is the condition of the conditional expression (or ternary operator). np.any(nums % 2 == 0) is a function call to np.any, which checks if any element of the input array is True. nums % 2 == 0 is a vectorized operation that checks if each number in nums is even.

# else 1: This is the else clause of the conditional expression. If the condition is not met (i.e., there are no even numbers in nums), the function returns 1.

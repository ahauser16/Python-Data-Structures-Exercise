## Here's a line-by-line explanation of the reverse_vowels1 function:

```
def reverse_vowels1(s):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    s = list(s)
    i, j = 0, len(s) - 1
    while i < j:
        if s[i] not in vowels:
            i += 1
        elif s[j] not in vowels:
            j -= 1
        else:
            s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
            i, j = i + 1, j - 1
    return "".join(s)
```

1. The reverse_vowels1 function is defined to take a string s as an argument:
```
def reverse_vowels1(s):
```

2. A string vowels is defined that contains all the vowels in both lowercase and uppercase:
```
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
```

3. The string s is converted into a list of characters. This is done because strings in Python are immutable, but lists are mutable:
```
s = list(s)
```

4. Two pointers i and j are initialized to the start and end of the list s:
```
i, j = 0, len(s) - 1
```

5. A while loop is started that continues as long as i is less than j:
```
while i < j:
```

6. If the character at index i is not a vowel, i is incremented by 1:
```
if s[i] not in vowels:
    i += 1
```

7. Else if the character at index j is not a vowel, j is decremented by 1:
```
elif s[j] not in vowels:
    j -= 1
```

8. Else (both s[i] and s[j] are vowels), the characters at indices i and j are swapped, and then i is incremented and j is decremented:
```
else:
    s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
    i, j = i + 1, j - 1
```

9.  Finally, the list s is converted back into a string and returned. The join method concatenates all the characters in the list into a single string:
```
return "".join(s)
```

# Pros: This function is straightforward and easy to understand. It checks if sought is in collection or in collection[start:] depending on whether start is None.
# Cons: It does not check if collection is a list, string, or tuple before trying to slice it, which could lead to an error if collection is a set.
#refactor required: The includes1 function failed the test includes1({1, 2, 3}, 1, 3) because it tried to slice a set, which is not allowed in Python. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, and they do not support indexing or slicing.  The error message TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable indicates that the function tried to access a set using an index or slice, which caused the error.  To fix this issue, you can modify the function to ignore the start parameter if collection is a set. In this refactored version, the function checks if collection is a set before it checks if start is None. If collection is a set, the function returns sought in collection and ignores the start parameter. This avoids the error because the function no longer tries to slice a set.

#Pros: This function is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses slicing with a step of 2 to get every other item from lst. This is efficient and idiomatic Python. Cons: It creates a new list, which can be inefficient for large inputs.

#Pros: This function uses list comprehension and the enumerate function to get every other item from lst. This is a compact way to filter a list based on the index of each item. Cons: It's slightly more complex than the first function due to the use of enumerate and the modulo operator.

#Pros: This function uses a manual approach to get every other item from lst, which allows for more control and potential optimizations. It only iterates over lst once. Cons: It's more complex than the other two functions due to the use of a loop and the append method. It also does not take advantage of Python's high-level features.
